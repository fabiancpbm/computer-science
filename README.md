# Computer Science Lab

> **Problem**: I ever forget everything that I learn, so when I want to remember things, I need study from scratch. NO MORE!

This Computer Science Lab was created to (1) register what I've learned, (2) read when I need to review some knowledge, (3) update knowledge when needed, and (4) share knowledge.
